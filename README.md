# Incorrect Matrix Multiplication in R

This repository demonstrates a common error in R when performing matrix multiplication. The code attempts to multiply two matrices using the `*` operator, which results in element-wise multiplication rather than the correct matrix product. The solution shows how to use the `%*%` operator for proper matrix multiplication.
